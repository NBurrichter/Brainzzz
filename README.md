# Reasoned
Wintersemester 15/16 brain game

# Important Note!
The A* Pathfind asset that is used inside the project can for unknown reason not be completly added to Version Controll. 
To add the missing assets back into the game, the Unitypackage needs to be reimported. It can be downloaded at http://arongranberg.com/astar/download and is the free Beta Version 3.7.5 that is used.
