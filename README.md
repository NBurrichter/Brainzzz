# Reasoned
Wintersemester 15/16 brain game

# Important Note!
The A* Pathfind asset that is used inside the project, can for unknown reason sometimes not be added completly to Unity. If errors occur regarding the Pathfinding assets it needs to be reimported.
It can be downloaded at http://arongranberg.com/astar/download and is the free Beta Version 3.7.5 that is used. It is a unitypackage and can be added normaly.

# Unity Version:
The game needs to be run with Unity 5.2.2f1

# Opening the project
Opening the project for the first time can take a while. Espacially the videos may be wrongly imported. The latest Quicktime Version is needed to import the videos. 
If the start scene only shows a black or white screen, the videos need to be reimported.
